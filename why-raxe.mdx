## The Problem: AI Agents Are Under Attack

AI agents are not just chat interfaces. They execute code, access databases, call APIs, and make autonomous decisions. Every one of these capabilities is an attack surface.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Real attacks happening today:**

- Indirect injection via retrieved documents poisons RAG systems
- Multi-step jailbreaks bypass single-turn guardrails
- Encoded payloads (Base64, leetspeak) evade naive filters
- Tool manipulation turns your agent into an attacker's weapon

<Warning>
If your AI agent can execute tools, it can be weaponised. Training-time safety is not enough.
</Warning>

## Why Not Build It Yourself?

Building robust AI security seems straightforward until you try it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Detection rules take 6+ months to develop" icon="calendar">
    RAXE's 515+ rules were developed by security researchers who analysed thousands of real-world attacks. Each rule is tuned for precision (low false positives) and recall (catches variants). Building this from scratch means collecting attack datasets, writing and tuning regex patterns, and iterating for months.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Attackers evolve faster than you can respond" icon="rotate">
    New jailbreak techniques appear weekly. New persona attacks (DAN, DUDE, AIM) emerge constantly, encoding techniques evolve, and multi-step attacks chain innocuous prompts into exploits. Maintaining detection rules is a full-time job. RAXE's team does this so you don't have to.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Privacy is hard to get right" icon="lock">
    Sending prompts to a cloud API for security scanning defeats the purpose if that API is compromised. RAXE runs 100% on-device — no prompt data ever leaves your infrastructure, no network calls during scanning, and it works in air-gapped environments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
**Time to value**: RAXE gives you 6+ months of security research in a `pip install`.

## How RAXE Works

RAXE uses a dual-layer detection engine. [Learn how it works →](/concepts/detection-engine)

RAXE detects 14+ threat families including prompt injection, jailbreaks, and PII exposure. [See all threat families →](/concepts/threat-families)

## RAXE vs. Cloud Security Solutions

Many AI security products require sending your prompts to their cloud for analysis. Here's how RAXE compares:

| Feature | RAXE | Cloud-Only Solutions |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| **Privacy** | 100% local - prompts never leave your infrastructure | Prompts sent to third-party cloud |
| **Latency** | <1ms (L1) / <5ms (L1+L2) | 100-500ms network round-trip |
| **Cost** | Free (1,000 scans/day CE) / Predictable pricing | Per-API-call pricing adds up fast |
| **Offline** | Works without internet | Requires constant connectivity |
| **Compliance** | GDPR/HIPAA/SOC 2 friendly - no data residency concerns | Data residency and processing agreements required |
| **Reliability** | No external dependencies | Outages affect your production |
| **Air-gapped** | Works in isolated environments | Not possible |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Privacy Matters">
    **Your prompts contain sensitive data.** User queries, business logic, customer information - all flow through your AI agent. Sending this to a third-party API for security scanning creates a new attack surface.

    RAXE runs 100% on-device:
    - ML model executes locally (no cloud inference)
    - Rule matching happens in-process
    - Only anonymised telemetry (prompt hash, rule IDs) is sent - never content

    ```python
    # RAXE telemetry - what we send (never the prompt)
    {
        "prompt_hash": "sha256:a1b2c3...",  # Hash only
        "prompt_length": 156,                # Length only
        "rule_id": "pi-001",                # What matched
        "severity": "HIGH"                   # Result
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Latency Matters">
    Every millisecond counts in production. Cloud-based scanning adds 100-500ms of latency per request - that's 10-50x slower than RAXE.

    | Scan Type | RAXE | Cloud API |
    |-----------|------|-----------|
    | Pattern matching | <1ms | 100-200ms |
    | ML classification | ~3ms | 200-500ms |
    | Full scan | <5ms | 300-700ms |

    For real-time agents, cloud latency is unacceptable. Users notice delays over 100ms.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cost Matters">
    Cloud APIs charge per request. At scale, this adds up:

    | Daily Requests | Cloud Cost (est.) | RAXE Cost |
    |----------------|-------------------|-----------|
    | 10,000 | $10-50/day | $0 (CE) |
    | 100,000 | $100-500/day | $0 (CE) |
    | 1,000,000 | $1,000-5,000/day | $0 (CE) |

    RAXE Community Edition is free forever with 1,000 scans/day — more than enough for most teams. No surprise bills.
