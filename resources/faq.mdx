## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is RAXE?">
    RAXE is a privacy-first AI security platform that detects threats in LLM applications. It identifies prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, PII exposure, and other attacks before they reach your AI models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is RAXE open source?">
    RAXE Community Edition is **community-driven** but not open source. The detection rules (514) are shared with the community, but the core engine code is proprietary. You can inspect, validate, and contribute rules, but not modify the engine itself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it really free?">
    Yes! Community Edition is free forever with:
    - 1,000 scans/day
    - 514 detection rules
    - L1 (rule-based) + L2 (ML) detection
    - Full CLI and SDK access
    - Local-only processing

    Pro and Enterprise tiers offer higher limits, GPU acceleration, and additional features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does RAXE compare to alternatives?">
    | Feature | RAXE CE | Others |
    |---------|---------|--------|
    | Local-first | ✅ | Often cloud-only |
    | Privacy by design | ✅ | Varies |
    | Detection rules | 514 | Usually fewer |
    | ML detection | ✅ (CPU) | Often cloud |
    | Free tier | 1K/day | Limited or none |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does RAXE send my prompts to a server?">
    **No.** All scanning happens locally on your device. We never receive your prompts, responses, or matched text.

    Telemetry only includes:
    - Detection metadata (rule IDs, severity, counts)
    - Performance metrics (scan duration)
    - Prompt hash (SHA-256, for deduplication)

    We never see the actual content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What telemetry is collected?">
    ```json
    {
      "rule_id": "pi-001",        // Which rule triggered
      "severity": "high",          // Severity level
      "confidence": 0.95,          // Confidence score
      "scan_duration_ms": 4.2,     // Performance metric
      "prompt_hash": "sha256:...", // Hash for deduplication
      "version": "0.1.0",          // RAXE version
      "platform": "darwin"         // Platform info
    }
    ```

    **Never collected:** Prompts, responses, matched text, IP addresses, user IDs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I disable telemetry?">
    Pro+ users can disable telemetry:
    ```bash
    raxe telemetry disable
    ```

    Community Edition includes telemetry to help improve detection rules for everyone. The telemetry is privacy-preserving by design.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    Yes. RAXE is designed with privacy as a core principle:
    - All scanning is local
    - No content ever leaves your device
    - Telemetry is anonymized and aggregated
    - You can audit the telemetry payload in the code
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Python versions are supported?">
    RAXE requires **Python 3.10 or higher**. We recommend Python 3.11 for best performance.

    ```bash
    python --version  # Check your version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between L1 and L2 detection?">
    **L1 (Rule-Based):**
    - Fast regex pattern matching (~1ms)
    - 514 curated rules
    - Always available
    - Low false-positive rate

    **L2 (ML-Based):**
    - ONNX neural network models
    - Catches novel/obfuscated attacks
    - Requires `pip install raxe[ml]`
    - Slightly slower (~50ms)

    Both layers work together for comprehensive detection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fast is RAXE?">
    - **L1 only:** ~0.4ms (P50: 0.37ms, P95: 0.49ms)
    - **L2 only:** ~3ms
    - **L1 + L2:** ~3.5ms combined
    - **Throughput:** ~1,200 scans/second

    Performance depends on prompt length and hardware. See the [Detection Engine](/concepts/detection-engine) page for detailed benchmarks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does RAXE work offline?">
    Yes! All scanning works offline. The only network requirement is:
    - Initial API key validation (one-time)
    - Telemetry submission (non-blocking, fails silently)

    Scans continue to work even with no internet connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use RAXE with async code?">
    Yes! Use `AsyncRaxe`:
    ```python
    from raxe import AsyncRaxe

    async with AsyncRaxe() as raxe:
        result = await raxe.scan(prompt)
        results = await raxe.scan_batch(prompts)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which LLM providers are supported?">
    RAXE works with any LLM provider. We offer drop-in wrappers for:
    - **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
    - **Anthropic** (Claude)
    - **LangChain** (any model)

    For other providers, use the core SDK:
    ```python
    result = raxe.scan(prompt)
    if result.is_safe:
        response = your_llm.complete(prompt)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use RAXE in CI/CD?">
    Yes! Use the `--ci` flag for CI-optimized output:
    ```bash
    raxe scan "$PROMPT" --ci
    # Exit code 0 = safe, 1 = threat, 2 = error
    ```

    See [CI/CD Integration](/integrations/ci-cd) for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I protect streaming responses?">
    For streaming, scan the complete response:
    ```python
    chunks = []
    for chunk in llm.stream(prompt):
        chunks.append(chunk)
        yield chunk

    # Scan complete response
    full_response = "".join(chunks)
    result = raxe.scan(full_response)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rules & Detection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many rules does RAXE have?">
    Community Edition includes **514 detection rules** across 7 threat families:
    - PI (59) - Prompt Injection
    - JB (77) - Jailbreak
    - PII (112) - Personal Information
    - CMD (65) - Command Injection
    - ENC (70) - Encoding/Obfuscation
    - HC (65) - Harmful Content
    - RAG (12) - RAG Attacks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create custom rules?">
    Yes! Add YAML rules to `~/.raxe/rules/`:
    ```yaml
    rule_id: "custom-001"
    name: "My Custom Rule"
    severity: "HIGH"
    confidence: 0.90
    patterns:
      - pattern: "(?i)my\\s+pattern"
    ```

    See [Custom Rules](/rules/custom-rules) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting false positives?">
    Check the confidence score:
    ```python
    for detection in result.detections:
        if detection.confidence > 0.9:
            # High confidence - likely real threat
            handle_threat(detection)
        else:
            # Lower confidence - review manually
            log_for_review(detection)
    ```

    You can also create suppression rules for known false positives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I contribute rules?">
    1. Fork [raxe-ai/raxe-ce](https://github.com/raxe-ai/raxe-ce)
    2. Add rule to `src/raxe/packs/core/v1.0.0/rules/{family}/`
    3. Validate: `raxe validate-rule your-rule.yaml`
    4. Submit a pull request
